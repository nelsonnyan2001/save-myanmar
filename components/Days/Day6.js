            Wi-fi and mobile data and any access to the internet for civilians
            cut out today.

            We're not sure what's happening. Calls and SMS still work, so people
            are communicating full-time on there. We're trying to keep up with
            each other, but we worry that there's something bigger, more
            sinister about to befall us.

            There's been announcements being made that the internet blockage
            will go throuh until the end of the week. So 48 hours of no
            communication. That's what this spells.
            <br />
            <br />
            Unbeknownst to us, people from abroad are sending messages and
            protesting in their respective countries, trying to get their
            governments to do something - anything.
            <br />
            <br />
            Still not a word out of anyone about why.

            There's talk of very, very big protests being organized tomorrow.
            Peaceful ones - we don't want to give the military any more reason
            to clamp down on us more than they already have.
            <br />
            <br />
            SMS becomes a virtual social media network. People spam messages to
            everyone in their contacts, asking them to relay the messages on to
            the contacts of the recipients.
            <br />
            <br />
            We try to warn each other of possible... anything. We're not sure
            what we're preparing for.

            Maybe it's the anger. Maybe it's being left in the dark. Maybe it's
            the fucking hopelessness of it all.
            <br />
            <br />
            The beating of pots and pans start early today. The sound is
            cacophonous. It stretches on for miles and miles, and basically
            everyone joins in.

            "The Lady has been released."
            <br />
            <br />
            The military-owned TV channels declared that Daw Aung San Suu Kyi
            had been released. It's the first good news we've had in almost a
            week.
            <br />
            <br />
            Ecstatic and uncontrollable, people take to the streets and yell in
            happiness. People go around in groups with cars honking horns.
            Fireworks go off. Literally, fireworks go off.
            <br />
            <br />
            Maybe that should have tipped us off.

            Of course it's fake news. It's genuinely sad to see how easy it is
            to lie to a nation so desperate for hope. For one person to lie to
            another and to have it spread like cancer, a growth festering on a
            population that has nothing left to hold on to.
            <br />
            <br />
            Strangely enough, the news only strengthens our resolve for the
            protests tomorrow. Of course we mourn, but we are past locking our
            doors and waiting for someone to save us.
            <br />
            <br />
            It is time for action.
