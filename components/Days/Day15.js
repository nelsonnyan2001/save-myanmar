            Almost like clockwork, all connections cut off.

            <br />
            We're plunged into darkness. For some cities, quite literally.

            The military took out the power plants in some towns, rendering them
            completely out of electricity. One cell phone battery and some
            candles to guide them on through this night.

            We wake up to stories of break-ins by some convicts - you know,
            everyday things at this point - and...
            <br />
            <br />
            That's it, actually.
            <br />
            <br />
            Can you imagine how mystifying it is to be worried that NOTHING bad
            happened?

            6 flights occured over the blackout of last night.
            <br />
            <br />3 round trips from Kunming, China. Some say they were carrying
            troops. Some say they were carrying weapons. And the military says
            they were carrying seafood.
            <br />
            <br />
            We are living in a time and place where planes carrying guns and
            weapons are more believable than planes carrying seafood.

            Widespread violence has started.
            <br />
            <br />
            Innocent people doing nothing are being bullied by police and
            soldiers.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you're reading this some time in the future, there's so many news
            outlets out there that reported the violence that broke out today.
            <br />
            <br />
            No deaths confirmed just yet, but there's an impending sense of doom
            that that's about to change very, very soon.
