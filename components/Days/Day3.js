            Day 3.
            <br />
            <br />
            Day 3 of hoping something changes.
            <br />
            <br />
            Day 3 of being worried about repeating history.
            <br />

            Day 3 of a military rule.

            It's funny, reading comments online. Governments express their
            "condemnations". Celebrities express their "concern".
            <br />
            <br /> At the same time, there's equally as many people criticizing
            the country. Criticizing our leaders, speaking as if they knew
            better than the people that live here.
            <br />
            <br />A ping-pong match between people that don't live here, that
            have never experienced the horrors of absolute military rule.

            Daw Aung San Suu Kyi gets arrested for possession of an unlicensed

            We sing a song in defiance. Called "Kabar Ma Kyay", it's a play on
            words on the national anthem.
            <br />
            <br />
            The noise goes on for noticeably longer than yesterday.
