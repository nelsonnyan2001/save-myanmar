            Work returns to normal for some of us. Others reach out to friends
            and family, checking in and making sure everything is fine.
            <br />
            <br />
            Yet others continue the fight on social media.

            CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
            <br />
            <br />
            We will not protest on the streets. We will not provide an excuse
            for an actual military takeover.
            <br />
            <br />
            Instead, we will protest the safest way we know how - everyday
            business will NOT resume until the detained military members are
            released.

            To some of us, this means nothing. To others, it is the end of any
            hopes we had of studying, working or meeting people we love abroad.

            <br />
            There are plans for the country to rally behind a peaceful protest
            at 8 o'clock tonight.

            The fateful banging of the pots and pans.
            <br />
            <br />
            There's a belief in Myanmar, where we'll bang pots and pans, honk
            cars and cause a lot of nuisance in general.
            <br />
            <br />
            We believe it drives away evil.
            <br />
            <br />
            We hope it drives away evil.
            <br />
            <br />
            We hope.
