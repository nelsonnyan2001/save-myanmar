            Valentine's day for some of you.
            <br />
            <br />
            The end of the second week of a coup for the rest of us.
            <br />
            <br />
            Lovers unite on the streets for protests.

            New date idea for you, dear reader?

            Everything is relatively normal in the morning today.
            <br />
            <br />
            Wake up, get mad at the military, get scared for the future and get
            ready for more protesting.
            <br />
            <br />
            Humans are so fucking adaptable we managed to come up with a daily
            military coup routine.

            The internet's going to be cut off from 1:00 a.m. midnight to 9:00
            a.m. the next morning.
            <br />

            What an announcement. The amount of speculation, fear and warning
            bells this set off, I tell ya.

            Right after the announcement, the military pulls up.
            <br />
            <br />
            Tanks, trucks filled with soldiers, UAV's and jeeps. You name it,
            you saw it. They rode into every major city in Myanmar. We suspect
            it has something to do with tonight.
            <br />
            <br />
            We set up civilian guards armed with sticks and branches at the head
            of every township. We block the roads with our cars, knowing it
            doesn't make a difference but trying regardless.
            <br />
            <br />
            Because no one will protect us if we don't protect ourselves.
