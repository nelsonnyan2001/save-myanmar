We hope we will not have to beat these pans for much longer.</p></div></div><hr/></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/timeline","query":{},"buildId":"ai4wzcjR78XgTI5C5Ql2S","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false}</script><script nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-8f31809deb7932dd0187.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-b4ebf216196896b96e65.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-50bee04d1dc61f8adf5b.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework.29f9e2f3d4a33bafbaa5.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/commons.ebd1abf0bb4c318ec5c8.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-7391217c2bf88d2679f0.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/timeline-75ea6b9fd7864c9d6def.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/ai4wzcjR78XgTI5C5Ql2S/_buildManifest.js" async=""></script><script src="/_next/static/ai4wzcjR78XgTI5C5Ql2S/_ssgManifest.js" async=""></script></body></html>
