              Support each other - this doesn't get stressed enough.

              <br />
              Raise awareness. This doesn't just mean changing your profile
              picture to red and smacking yourself on the back and calling it a
              day.
              <br />
              <br />
              Don't spam the comment sections of public figures from abroad. As
              much as you might think it helps, it doesn't.
              <br />
              <br />
              Support Civil Disobedience as much as you can. If you're too young
              to, try to convince people around you.
              <br />
              <br />
              Don't believe everything you hear. Don't spread everything you
              hear.
              <br />
              <br />
              Don't protest on the streets. <br />
              <br />
              Every little bit helps.

              Do everything you can to let people around you know. More likely
              than not, there's probably a protest going on near you.
              <br />
              <br />
              These early few days will be the most critical. We cannot afford
              to have people stop caring.
              <br />
              <br />
              Get the leaders of your respective countries to care. A resolution
              has to be reached.
